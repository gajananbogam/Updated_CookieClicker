1. The solution file is in CookieClicker_Autiomation folder.
2. I have covered high level scenarios, just to show my coding standards. I can automate further more scenarios as well.
3. I used Selenium webdriver with C# and xUnit frame work.
4. There could be some sync issues, because of which few testcases might fail in your local system.
5. I have executed entire regression test suite and all were passed in my local system. I have attached the evidence of the execution as well.
6. I have attached excel document where I have designed test scenarios and testcases along with the execution status.
7. For some of the bugs I have attached the screenschots in the same excel sheet as well, kindly check them for the reference purpose.
8. For any questions kindly let me know.

Many thanks.
